## Description

Spammers target old posts in a hope that you won't notice the comments on them. Why not stop them in their tracks by just shutting off comments and pingbacks? [Auto-Close Comments, Pingbacks and Trackbacks](https://webberzone.com/plugins/autoclose/) let's you automatically close comments, pingbacks and trackbacks on your posts, pages and custom post types.

You can also choose to keep comments / pingbacks / trackbacks open on certain posts, page or custom post types. Just enter a comma-separated list of post IDs in the Settings page.

An extra feature is the ability to delete post revisions that were introduced in WordPress v2.6 onwards.

### Key features

* **Scheduling**: You can also schedule a cron job to automatically close comments, pingbacks and trackbacks daily
